<h1>📊 Sales Analytics Internship Project</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Mobile & Laptop Sales Analysis</h2>

<p>
This project was completed as a <strong>core internship assignment</strong> during my 
<strong>Data Analytics Internship at Codec Technologies</strong>, conducted from 
<strong>August 2025 to October 2025</strong>. The project was designed and assigned by my mentor to simulate a 
<strong>real-world business analytics problem</strong>, requiring structured analytical thinking, data processing, and insight-driven reporting.
</p>

<p>
As part of the internship curriculum, I was provided with a large-scale sales dataset and was responsible for performing 
end-to-end <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> using Python. The objective was not only to analyze the data but also to 
translate raw data into meaningful business insights, following industry-standard analytical practices.
</p>

<p>
The internship program at Codec Technologies included comprehensive lecture videos, guided training sessions, and continuous mentor feedback, 
allowing me to understand both the theoretical foundations and their practical implementation in real-world data scenarios.

<h2>🎯 Project Objective & Business Problem</h2>

<p>
The primary objective of this internship assignment was to:
</p>

<blockquote>
Analyze mobile phone and laptop sales data to uncover trends in revenue generation, customer purchasing behavior, regional demand patterns, product preferences, and operational performance, and to communicate these findings in a clear, business-focused manner.
</blockquote>

<p>
The project was intentionally structured to reflect analytical tasks commonly handled by entry-level data analysts in professional organizations, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Understanding ambiguous business questions</li>
    <li>Working with large transactional datasets</li>
    <li>Performing exploratory analysis to identify hidden patterns</li>
    <li>Supporting decision-making through data-backed insights</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Dataset Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Time Coverage:</strong> March 2023 – May 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Product Categories:</strong> Mobile Phones, Laptops</li>
    <li><strong>Nature of Data:</strong> Transactional sales data designed to replicate real-world retail operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Attributes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Product names and technical specifications</li>
    <li>Brand and processor details</li>
    <li>Price and quantity sold per transaction</li>
